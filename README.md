# Trading-Algorithms

This repository represents the current state of an ambitious project on my part to implement and simulate a version of every major stock trading indicator used today.

If there's an indicator I'm missing that you think I should include, don't hesitate to get in touch or open an issue!

## Getting Started
Welcome to the project! Thank you for stopping by.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The code in this repository requires Python 3.4 or later. If you are running an older version of Python, [download the latest version here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The following installation instructions assume a familiarity running commands in a Terminal. __If you are unfamiliar with running commands on a terminal, there are two conventions to keep in mind__ when following the below instructions: (1) The ```$``` sign is a convention indicating that the following command is a command to be run in Terminal; do not include it when actually running your commands. (2) Square brackets are used to indicate variable information that you should include without the square brackets. For example, if a command says, `$ cd [project_folder]`, the real command would look something like `$ cd Trading-Algorithms` depending on the name of the project folder and your current location in your computer's file tree.

### Installation

1. Download the git repository to your computer:
```
$ git clone [project_url]
```

2. Edit the trading simulator file with the parameters you wish to simulate, then run the file.
```
$ python3 trading_simulator.py
```
